          <p>We live in an age full of intelligence: artificial intelligence, smart phones, smart cars, smart homes etc. But where is the <span className="italic">wisdom</span>?</p>
          <p>
            Technology evolved too fast, and wisdom didn't catch up yet. It's about time it does.
            Tools like internet, AI or blockchain can bring us together, make us smart, safeguard our freedoms, but they can just as well create a dystopian future.
            It will all depend what we, the humans, make of them. Our intelligence creates the tools, and our wisdom should dictate how we use them.

          <h3 id="title">How?</h3>
          <p>
            I write stories because they give emotion and soul to otherwise cold ideas.
            They say an image is worth a thousand words; likewise, a story is worth a thousand maxims.
            From one story, we each can draw our own unique interpretations and lessons that resonate with us.
            If the Ancients crafted myths to vehicle wisdom that was passed down countless generations, it's because stories are so powerful.
            My tales aim at being like those myths, drawing new lessons from old times.

          <h3 id="title">Time for Axial Age 2.0</h3>
          <p>
            Around the 5th century BCE, something major happened: most of the world wisdom was written down. Everywhere, and all at once.
            In Greece, Socrates and Plato gave birth to Western philosophy; in Babylon, the exiled Judeans wrote the Torah; in Iran, Zarathustra was teaching the Avesta;
            In India, the great Hindu epics were written and the Buddha came; in China, Confucius and Laozi shaped Chinese thought for millennia to come...
            This 5th century wisdom explosion event is called the Axial Age.
            What Socrates, Zarathustra or Laozi wrote still applies today, but they didn't have the internet, or AI, or globalization.
            So now is the time for the Axial Age 2.0! We should not replace ancient wisdom, but update it.
            Through my tales, I hope to contribute to this Axial Age 2.0.
